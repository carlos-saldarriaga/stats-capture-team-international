# Stats capture

 `Stats capture allows  some basic statistics on a collection of small positive integers`

The DataCapture object accepts numbers and returns an object for querying
statistics about the inputs. Specifically, the returned object supports
querying how many numbers in the collection are less than a value, greater
than a value, or within a range.
